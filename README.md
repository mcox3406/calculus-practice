## Purpose
Too much Mathematica, not enough pencil and paper... This website is my attempt to reverse this trend. You can use it to practice being quick at math problemsâ€”it's like [Zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com), but for more complex problems.

## Contributing to the Project
If you have any suggestions for problems or feature requests, please just [open an issue](https://github.com/mcox3406/calculus-practice/issues) or submit a pull request. I don't expext this to be a very active project, but I'll try to add more problems as I can.
