          The Problem

            As I was going through the Course X core classes at MIT, I often found myself shockingly slow at solving basic math problems. Considering that I used to be able to solve these same types of problems extremely quickly in middle/high school, this was a bit of a wake up call regarding the deterioration of my mathematical skills. Too much Mathematica, not enough pencil and paper... This website is my attempt to reverse this trend.

            The problems are designed to help you do the following: 
        </p>

        <ul style={{
          listStyleType: "disc",
          paddingLeft: "2rem",
          marginBottom: "1.5rem"
        }}>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>Build speed and pattern recognitions</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>Boost confidence with basic operations</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>Free up mental resources for tougher problems</li>
          <li style={{ marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>Lower exam anxiety</li>
        </ul>

        <p style={{
          lineHeight: "1.6",

        }}>
            I think the value of this extends well beyond just using this for MIT classes. There is something to be said about having very quick mental math ability, and I think this is a way to help develop that.
